visit
=====

visits all urls listed in a file through all proxies listed in a different file. I included the proxies.txt file and urls.txt for formatting and testing purposes, but you could add as many urls or proxies as you want to those files, as long as each on is on a new line and in the same format as the first line given. It will ping each of those urls/servers through each proxy in that file. Then it will move on to the next url and do the same, etc. etc.
